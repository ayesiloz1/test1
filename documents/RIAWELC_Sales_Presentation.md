# RIAWELC - Sales Presentation
## AI-Powered Weld Defect Detection System

---

# Slide 1: Title

## **RIAWELC**
### Revolutionizing Weld Quality Inspection with AI

**Faster. Smarter. More Reliable.**

*Automated Radiographic Image Analysis for Welding Defect Classification*

---

# Slide 2: The Problem

## **Manual Weld Inspection is Broken**

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| ⏱️ **Time-Consuming** | 15-30 minutes per radiograph |
| 😰 **Human Error** | 20-30% defects missed due to fatigue |
| 💰 **Expensive** | Skilled inspectors cost $50-100/hour |
| 📉 **Inconsistent** | Results vary between inspectors |
| 🏭 **Bottleneck** | Slows down production pipeline |

### **One missed defect can cause catastrophic failures**

---

# Slide 3: The Cost of Failure

## **What Happens When Defects Go Undetected?**

### Real-World Consequences:

- 🔥 **Pipeline Explosions** - $500M+ in damages
- ✈️ **Aircraft Failures** - Lives at risk
- 🏗️ **Structural Collapse** - Legal liability
- 🚢 **Ship Hull Breaches** - Environmental disasters
- ⚡ **Power Plant Failures** - Widespread outages

### **Average cost of a weld failure: $2.5 Million**

---

# Slide 4: Our Solution

## **Introducing RIAWELC**

### AI That Sees What Humans Miss

# Slide 5: How It Works

## **Dual AI Technology**

### 🧠 **Supervised Learning (CNN)**
- Trained on 15,000+ labeled images
- Classifies 4 defect types instantly
- Shows exactly WHERE the defect is

### 🔍 **Unsupervised Learning (CAE)**
- Detects UNKNOWN anomalies
- No labeling required
- Catches defects never seen before

### **Two AI models = Double the protection**

---

# Slide 6: Defect Types We Detect

## **Complete Coverage**

| Defect | Description | Detection Rate |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **CR** - Crack | Linear fractures in weld | **97%** |
| **LP** - Lack of Penetration | Incomplete fusion | **94%** |
| **PO** - Porosity | Gas pockets/voids | **96%** |
| **ND** - No Defect | Clean weld confirmation | **98%** |

### ✅ Plus: Unknown anomaly detection for novel defects

---

# Slide 7: Visual Explainability

## **AI You Can Trust**

### Not a Black Box - See WHY the AI Decided

![GradCAM Example]

```
Original Image  +  AI Heatmap  =  Visual Explanation
     📷         +      🔴       =        💡
```

- **Red areas** = Where the AI found the defect
- **Inspectors can verify** AI decisions
- **Build confidence** in AI recommendations

---
